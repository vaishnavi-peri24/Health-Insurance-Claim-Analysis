## Usage

1. Place `insurance_claims.csv` in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
   ```sh
   python "Claim_insurance project"
   ```
3. Visualizations and model results will be displayed in the output and saved to the `images/` folder.

## Visualizations

Below are some of the key plots generated by the script (located in the `images/` folder):

### 1. Fraud Distribution
**Description:**
 Shows the overall distribution of fraudulent (`Y`) vs. non-fraudulent (`N`) claims in the dataset. This helps identify class imbalance, which is important for model evaluation and selection.

### 2. Incident Type vs Fraud
**Description:**
Displays the count of each incident type, separated by whether the claim was fraudulent or not. This reveals which types of incidents are more likely to be associated with fraud.

### 3. Claim Amount Distribution by Fraud
**Description:**
Compares the distribution of claim amounts for fraudulent and non-fraudulent claims. This helps determine if fraudulent claims tend to have higher or lower claim amounts.

### 4. Confusion Matrix
**Description:**
Visualizes the model’s performance by showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Useful for quickly assessing classification accuracy and types of errors.

### 5. ROC Curve
**Description:**
Plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. The ROC curve helps evaluate the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, with the area under the curve (AUC) indicating overall performance.

### 6. Precision-Recall Curve
**Description:**
Shows the trade-off between precision and recall for different thresholds. Especially useful for imbalanced datasets, as it focuses on the performance for the positive (fraud) class.

### 7. SHAP Summary Plot
**Description:**
Provides a global explanation of the model’s predictions by showing the impact of each feature on the output. Features are ranked by importance, helping to interpret which variables most influence fraud detection.

## Dataset

The dataset contains columns such as:
- Customer demographics
- Policy details
- Incident and claim information
- Target variable: `fraud_reported` (Y/N)

---

## Recent Changes

- **Added image references:** The README now includes references to key EDA and model evaluation plots, which should be saved in the `images/` folder.
- **Clarified usage:** Updated instructions to mention that plots are saved to the `images/` folder.
- **Expanded project structure:** Now includes the `images/` folder.
- **Improved documentation:** Added more detail to each section for clarity.
